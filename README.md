# NPS - National Park Service App

A National Park Service app built with **React** and **Vite**. This project is part of [Code the Dream's]("https://codethedream.org/) React course.

## Reason for Working on a National Park Service App

It is fun to work on a site about nature as this is something we all enjoy! Also, I love working with beautiful images - and the NPS API provides a rich supply. Finally, I appreciate the NPS API page which is clear and to the point.
